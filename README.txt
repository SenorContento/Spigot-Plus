# Spigot-Plus
Any improvments are welcome, especially improvments to speed and effeciency.
This plugin intends to be an all in one replacement for MultiVerse, PerWorldInventory, CreativeGates, and many other plugins.
Note that the formentioned plugins are good plugins but for my purposes they weren't sutable either from lack of maintenence, missing features, or just not fitting my requirements/use case. There may also be a bit of "I want to do it all by myself" mixed in.
At any rate my plugin is on github in the hopes that others may find it to be useful. As far as features go, any given feature or bug will be fixed or added as it becomes needed for the plugin to continue to meet my requirements. Lastly this plugin was developed and tested to mix nicely with WorldEdit, CraftBook, CommandBook, WorldGuard, PermissionsEX, and ModifyWorld.

ToDo
- Clean up the existing code
-- Remove unneeded debugging
-- Remove unneeded methods
- Implement all commands properly
- Implement proper permissions support
- Fix any bugs found during testing

The $ next to each feature name tells who has claimed that feature and is responible for maintaining it
